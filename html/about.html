            <p class="about-description">Please consider voting for Pat Goldammer for State Assembly District 83. I am a
                conservative Republican outsider who will bring a fresh perspective to Madison. As a 6th generation
                Wisconsinite my love for Wisconsin runs deep. My experience and background have prepared me well for this
                position. I am a small business owner and former Captain for Midwest Express Airlines. I’m approaching 25
                years of marriage to my wonderful wife Vesta. We have 4 children that are between 17 and 21.</p>
            <p class="about-description">I was raised in Waukesha County, and I am a graduate of Marquette University High
                School and the University of Milwaukee. My flying career brought me all over the United States and I chose
                to raise my family in Wisconsin. What a great decision that was.</p>

            <img src="../images/PatAndSonsFootball.jpeg" alt="Headshot of Pat" class="about-picture">

            <p class="about-description">I have been a youth football and baseball coach along with volunteering with the
                Boy Scouts of America. I am a proud Eagle Scout and even prouder father of an Eagle Scout. I am a twice
                elected Trustee in the Village of Waterford where I have served on the finance, public works, joint review,
                and community development authority boards. We have had a lot of spirited debates on the board, but I am
                humbled that all 6 of my colleague’s are supporting me for the State Assembly. If someone disagrees with me,
                they are not my enemy.</p>

            <img src="../images/PatAndScruffles.jpeg" alt="Headshot of Pat" class="about-picture">

            <p class="about-description">I am also a commissioner on the Racine County Sewerage Board where I was appointed
                by Racine County Executive Jonathan Delgrave with help from County Board Chair Tom Roanhouse. I am pleased
                to have the endorsement of these fine gentlemen for my run for State Assembly. </p>

            <p class="about-description">I also serve as a volunteer on the Racine County Deer Advisory Board. Also serving
                on this board is Scott Gunderson who was a great 16 year State Assemblyman for the 83rd district before he
                served in leadership in the DNR. Thank you, Gundy, for your endorsement!</p>
            <p class="about-description">I look forward to meeting with and representing the people of the 83rd.</p>
