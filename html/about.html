        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="text_column">Please consider voting for Pat Goldammer for State Assembly District 83. I am a conservative Republican outsider who will bring a fresh perspective to Madison. As a 6th generation Wisconsinite my love for Wisconsin runs deep. My experience and background have prepared me well for this position. I am a small business owner and former Captain for Midwest Express Airlines. I’m approaching 25 years of marriage to my wonderful wife Vesta. We have 4 children that are between 17 and 21.</p>
            <p class="text_column">I was raised in Waukesha County, and I am a graduate of Marquette University High School and the University of Milwaukee. My flying career brought me all over the United States and I chose to raise my family in Wisconsin. What a great decision that was.</p>
            <p class="text_column">I have been a youth football and baseball coach along with volunteering with the Boy Scouts of America. I am a proud Eagle Scout and even prouder father of an Eagle Scout. I am a twice elected Trustee in the Village of Waterford where I have served on the finance, public works, joint review, and community development authority boards. We have had a lot of spirited debates on the board, but I am humbled that all 6 of my colleague’s are supporting me for the State Assembly. If someone disagrees with me they are not my enemy.</p>
            <p class="text_column">I am also a commissioner on the Racine County Sewerage Board where I was appointed by Racine County Executive Jonathan Delgrave with help from County Board Chair Tom Roanhouse. I am pleased to have the endorsement of these fine gentlemen for my run for State Assembly. </p>
            <p class="text_column">I also serve as a volunteer on the Racine County Deer Advisory Board. Also serving on this board is Scott Gunderson who was a great 16 year State Assemblyman for the 83rd district before he served in leadership in the DNR. Thank you, Gundy, for your endorsement!</p>
            <p class="text_column">I look forward to meeting with and representing the people of the 83rd.</p>
