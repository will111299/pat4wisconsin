            <h2>Welcome</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="text_column">I'm excited to announce my run for Wisconsin State Assembly. The past 2 weeks I have
                been out in the community listening to what the people of Wisconsin's 83rd State Assembly District are
                looking for in a leader. After conversations in the communities of Big Bend, East Troy, Mukwonago,
                Muskego, Troy Center, Vernon, and Waterford I have decided to enter the race to become our community's
                next representative in Madison.</p>
            <p class="text_column">As a locally elected Trustee in the Village of Waterford I promise to bring my same
                no nonsense, hardworking, and collaborative attitude to the Capitol.</p>
            <p class="text_column">I have lived in the 83rd district for over 20 years and was born and raised in
                Waukesha County. My wife and I have had the privilege of raising four kids in this area and I am so
                grateful for everything that it has offered. I believe that now it is my time to give back to the
                community.</p>
            <p class="text_column">As a proud Republican I will make sure to uphold the 83rd District's Republican
                values. During my time on the Village of Waterford Board I have a proven track record of being fiscally
                conservative. As a lifelong hunter and outdoorsman, I am a proud supporter of our Second Amendment
                rights.  I will protect the sanctity of life, support our police and first responders, fight for fiscal
                responsibility, smaller government, and local control.  I promise to always be easily accessible to the
                people of Wisconsin's 83rd and will fight every day that I am in office to better people's lives who
                live in the 83rd District.</p>
            <p class="text_column">There will be a lot of work to be done between now and our primary on August 9th,
                but I am so excited to do it. I am humbled by the early support and endorsements that I have received.
                I look forward to hearing more from the constituents of the 83rd in these upcoming months.</p>
